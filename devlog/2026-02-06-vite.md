# 2026-02-06 — Vite Web MVP Sprint

## Summary
We completed the MVP browser search epic and expanded the filters/explainability epic. The web UI now supports catalog import, local storage, a lexical index worker, search + result shaping, ranking UI, details view, filters, and explainability highlights. We also added an issue summary command and updated documentation.

## What Shipped
- Catalog schema parsing and import with local storage (OPFS/IndexedDB).
- Lexical index worker (tokenization + inverted index) with build status.
- Search query flow + result shaping with “why it matched”.
- Results list ranking UI with score bar and stock emoji.
- Details view with attribution, specs, and matched tokens.
- Filters: in-stock and price range, active filter chips.
- Layout changes: hero full width, index + filters in a 50/50 collapsible section.
- Issue tracker: new `summary` command for epics.
- README: Web MVP quickstart.

## Notable Fixes
- Worker module loading in Vite via `?worker` import and timeout/error handling.
- Highlighting now tolerates missing matched tokens.

## Open Items
- Category lookup mapping in details view (filters epic `filters-050`).
  - Need a source for category names (file/API/hardcoded).

## Files Touched (high-level)
- `web/src/App.tsx`
- `web/src/styles.css`
- `web/src/catalog.ts`
- `web/src/storage.ts`
- `web/src/search.ts`
- `web/src/lexicalWorkerClient.ts`
- `web/src/workers/lexicalIndexWorker.ts`
- `web/src/vite-env.d.ts`
- `scripts/issue.py`
- `issues/*.jsonl`
- `README.md`

## Notes
- MVP epic is now marked done; filters epic is in-progress with one remaining task.
